# Cycles

I implement a version of six-week cycles, which I've borrowed from [Basecamp](). That cadence, I believe, gives enough sense of urgency and helps keep projects from creeping too large, as well as gives us a regular interval to decide what we're doing. 

The core of this idea is: we want to break big projects down into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time. This gives us a kind of rhythm that lets us keep our eye on priorities during six-week periods. Between each six week cycle, there will be a one week cooldown to catch up on smaller backlog items and figuring out the next tasks for the next cycle. 

# Check-Ins

While we'll occasionally do 1:1 meetings, I run almost all of our conversations, to-dos, and project management through Basecamp. Since it can be hard to keep up on what everyone is doing, there are three mechanisms in place to help keep everyone in the loop about work that's happening. 

First, there's a daily question of What did you work on today? This is the nitty gritty details written as a personal narrative. 

Second, there's a weekly question What will you be working on this week? This answers the nitty gritty at a higher level.

Third, there are team updates (as necessary). These usually happen midway through a six-week cycle or at the end of a cycle. This is big-level presentation work, and the main way for you to keep in the loop with what we're focusing on at a high level.
