Hi, and welcome to the team. I'm thrilled to have you here at $PLACE.

Odds are good it's going to take you about three months to figure out things around here. I get that you want to make a good first impression and get some checks in the win column, but workplaces are complex places with complex humans. Take your time, meet folks, go to meetings, participate in culture stuff as you can (but don't feel obligated), write things down, ask lots of questions. 

What the below details is our working relationship. This is something of a user guide for how I work, and it captures what you can expect from me in an average week. My hope is to give you a sense of me, which will hopefully establish our working relationship quickly. 

## In an Average Week

We'll have a 1:1 every week for at least thirty minutes. These are for topics of substance -- I'm not interested in updates. We have a shared Basecamp space for those things, and you'll be prompted for that information at the end of every week. We'll use pings between us in Basecamp to capture future topics as well as keep a history of what we've discussed. Anytime you or I think of a topic, it goes there. 

You can hit me up on Basecamp twenty-four hours a day. I typically respond quickly, but responses might be slower outside regular work hours. I don't check emails outside of business hours or on weekends -- those are times reserved for me and my family.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of that in advance. All our meetings will still occur, considering time zones. 

I might work a bit on weekends. I do this by choice. **I do not expect you to work on the weekend**. You might get pings on Basecamp from me, but these won't be urgent unless marked so. Everything can wait until Monday. 

I take vacations and you should too. Disconnected from work is when I sometimes do my best work. When you're on vacation, turn everything off -- don't check Basecamp, don't check email. 

## Principles

**Humans first**. Informed, happy, and productive humans build great things. I optimize for that. 

**Leadership comes from everywhere**. While managers are useful for scaling organizations, they don't have a monopoly on leadership. I work hard to build in costructs and opportunities for people to effectively lead. 

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly**. I believe that most humans are trying to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action**. Long meetings with endless debates around potential directions are sometimes valuable, but I believe that starting something is the best way to begin learning and making progress. This is not always the correct strategy. 

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things**. In engineering terms, there are always bugs to be fixed everywhere.

**I start with the assumption of positive intent for all involved**. This has worked out well for me.

## Meetings

I go to a lot of meetings. By default, my calendar is public. If you have questions about a meeting, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden. The majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential. 

My meetings have 1) an agenda and/or intended purpose, 2) the appropriate amount of people, and 3) a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I'm attending a meeting, I expect to start on time. If it's not clear why I'm in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance. 

If a meeting ends its purpose early, let's give the time back to everyone. If the goal won't be achieved in the allotted time, let's stop the meeting before time is up and determine the next steps. 

## Misc

**I'm an introvert**. Prolongued exposure to humans is exhausting to me. If I'm in a larger meeting -- say eight people -- I might be pretty quiet. Don't confuse my silence with lack of engagement. 

**When a 1:1 feels over and there is remaining time** I will have topics for us to discuss. These are meant for brainstorming, and the topics are the things top-of-mind for me at the moment. We're doing real work here, not just shooting the breeze. 

**If I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions save everyone lots of time. 

**I can be hyperbolic** but that's usually because I'm excited about something. Sometimes I swear. 

**I like starting new things** but I know I sometimes lose interest when I can see how the thing is going to end. I'm trying to get better at this. 

**If you see me on my phone for more than thirty seconds in a meeting, call me out**. My attention sometimes wanders. Same goes for checking my Apple Watch.
