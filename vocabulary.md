# Vocabulary

Sometimes I have a vocabulary specific to the work I do. There's just a few, and I try not to be too cringeworthy. 

## Scope hammering

Something I borrowed from [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/vocabulary.md) some time ago. Scope hammering refers to how I think about the boundaries of a project and how it fits time and resource contraints. For many of the digital projects I work on, I implement a six-week cycle of work where we outline what can be accomplished in those six weeks -- and cut everything else extraneous. It means taking a project scope and hammering it down into the work that can be accomplished in the time that's left.
